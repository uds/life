# Introduction

Welcome to the Life project! This project is a vitalization developed using the principles of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It simulates the behavior of cells in a grid, following a set of rules that determine their survival or death.

## Sample Patterns

The Life project includes several sample patterns that you can use to explore the behavior of the cells. Some of the patterns available are:

- Glider: A pattern that moves diagonally across the grid.
- Blinker: A pattern that oscillates between two states.
- Toad: A pattern that oscillates between two states, but with a different shape than the blinker.
- Gosper Glider Gun: A configuration of cells that generates a stream of gliders, which are moving patterns that travel across the grid. 

Feel free to experiment with these patterns and create your own!

## Demo
