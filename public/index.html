        <h1>Welcome to the Life project!</h1>
        
        <p>This project is a vitalization developed using the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.</p>
        <p>It simulates the behavior of cells in a grid, following a set of rules that determine their survival or death.</p>   

        <h2>Sample Patterns</h2>
        
        <p>
            The Life project includes several sample patterns that you can use to explore the behavior of the cells. Some of the patterns available are:
            <ul>
                <li>Glider: A pattern that moves diagonally across the grid.</li>
                <li>Blinker: A pattern that oscillates between two states.</li> 
                <li>Toad: A pattern that oscillates between two states, but with a different shape than the blinker.</li>
                <li>Gosper Glider Gun: A configuration of cells that generates a stream of gliders, which are moving patterns that travel across the grid.</li>
            </ul>   
            Feel free to experiment with these patterns and create your own!
        </p>
